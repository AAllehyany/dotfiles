# Dotfiles Config

This is a dotfiles configuration for my setup. It is mainly used for `wezterm`, `helix`.
I will probably include a `nvim` config? Idk.

### How to use

On `MAC OS`, you can use `stow` to link these config files with their respective
config files on your home directory:
```shell
stow .
```
